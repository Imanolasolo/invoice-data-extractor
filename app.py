This is a demo project related to the [Learn LangChain](https://learnlangchain.org/) mini-course.
In this project we will use LangChain document loaders, prompts and parsers to develop an AI virtual
assistant trained to extract data from our PDF invoices and return them in JSON.

In a real-world use case, these data can be further processed and stored in an Excel file, sent
to our accounting software via API and handled according to out data pipeline needs.

    - Browse [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/francescocarlucci/invoice-data-extractor/blob/main/app.py) and make sure you understand it.
    - Fork the repository to customize the code.
    - Try to add new elements to parse and add them to the final JSON invoice. Maybe the VAT number? Or the taxes?
    - Improve this code and see if you can use a chain to better orchestrate the prompt and the parser. LLMChain should be ideal for this.
