# Invoice Data Extractor | Learn LangChain

This is a demo project related to the [Learn LangChain](https://learnlangchain.org/) mini-course.

In this project we will use LangChain document loaders, prompts and parsers to develop an AI virtual assistant
trained to extract data from our PDF invoices and return them in JSON. In a real-world use case, these data can
be further processed and stored in an Excel file, sent to our accounting software via API and handled according
to out data pipeline needs.
